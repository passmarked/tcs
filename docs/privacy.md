Consumers are more privacy aware then ever, and expect a clear to see and find terms of service and privacy policy on your site.

The homepage should have clear links to these pages with common used words. This will ensure trust and brand security as the policies keep changing.

# How do I fix this ?

Add a anchor link for example like:

```html
<a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
```

that links to your Privacy Policy.
